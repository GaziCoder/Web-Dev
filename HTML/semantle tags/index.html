                              Semantic tags are HTML elements that clearly describe the meaning of the content they contain—both to the browser and to developers. Instead of just saying how something should look, they give structure and context to web content.
Here are some common examples:
- <code>&lt; header &gt;</code> – Defines the introductory content for a page or section.
-<code>&lt; nav &gt;</code> – Specifies a section that contains navigation links.
-<code>&lt; main&gt;</code> – Indicates the main content of a document (unique and central).
- <code>&lt;<article> – Represents self-contained content that could be distributed or reused independently (like a blog post or news article).
-<code>&lt; <section> – Groups related content under a single theme (often with a heading).
- <code>&lt;<aside> – Used for tangentially related content, like a sidebar or callout.
-<code>&lt; <footer> – Represents the closing content of a section or page (like contact info, links, copyright).
Using semantic tags improves accessibility, helps search engines understand your content better, and makes your HTML easier to read and maintain.
