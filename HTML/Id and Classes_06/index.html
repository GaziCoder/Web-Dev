    <h1>What's the difference between these two Attributes?</h1>
    <h2>ID</h2>
    <p>Id is just like an indentity card.unique for everyone. Two elements can never have a same id.</p>
    <h2>Classes</h2>
    <div>Classes are like divisions. Multiple elements can have one same class. A single elemnt can have multiple classes. </div> 
</div>For eg, an input text can have only one id. However, it can have many classes such as bg color, text colour etc</div>
